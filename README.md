# Financial-Economics-Portfolio
This repository compiles selected assignments from the EC4333 Financial Economics II course at NUS. The projects explore **fixed income**, **interest rate modeling**, **portfolio optimization**, and **expected utility theory**, using both theoretical derivations and practical computational tools (STATA &amp; Excel).

### ðŸ“„ Homework 1: Yield Curves & Duration Risk
- Constructed **par yield**, **zero-coupon**, and **forward rate curves**
- Estimated zero-coupon rates using both **polynomial regression** and **Nelson-Siegel Extended (NSE)** models
- Computed bond prices and **$durations** for a bond portfolio
- Evaluated the hedging effectiveness of different portfolio structures under curve shocks

### ðŸ“„ Homework 2: Utility, Risk Aversion & Mean-Variance Optimization
- Analyzed concavity, risk aversion, and Arrow-Pratt measures from utility functions
- Applied **expected utility theory** to real-world decision problems (e.g., insurance pricing, investment selection)
- Demonstrated **Taylor expansion of utility functions** under normally distributed wealth
- Derived solutions to **minimum variance and constrained portfolios** using matrix algebra
